# TimeSeriesForecasting

This file contains two main sections. Firstly, it trains and evaluates a machine learning model to predict temperatures based on input data. Specifically, the model's predictions are stored in a DataFrame named val_results, which has 5000 rows with two columns for predicted values ("Val Predictions") and actual values ("Actuals"). Secondly, there is an exploration of weather data from January 1st, 2009, through December 31st, 2016. This section includes reading a CSV file containing temperature and pressure measurements at various time intervals, filtering the dataset, and displaying a portion of the filtered data. The resulting DataFrame has three columns—date and time, temperature, and atmospheric pressure—with approximately 7 million rows. In summary, this file involves training a model using historical data and exploring that same data set to visualize trends over time.
